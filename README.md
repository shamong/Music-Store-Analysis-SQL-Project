# Music-Store-Analysis-SQL-Project
Project explores music store data using SQL. Reveals top buyers, best-selling music by country, and customer spending patterns. Data stored in 11 relational tables covering customers, invoices, employees, artists, albums, tracks, genres, etc.

## Objective

The project aims to extract valuable customer insights from a music store's database using SQL queries. This analysis will reveal spending habits, popular genres by location, and top customer spenders for each artist.
## SQL queries

The SQL queries are divided into three sets:


Question Set 1 - Easy


Q1: Finds the most senior employee based on job title.

Q2: Identifies the countries with the most invoices.

Q3: Lists the top 3 invoice totals.

Q4: Determines the city with the highest sum of invoice totals.

Q5: Identifies the best customer (customer who has spent the most money).


Question Set 2 - Moderate


Q1: Lists all rock music listeners with their email, first name, last name, and genre.

Q2: Lists the top 10 rock bands by the number of tracks written.

Q3: Lists all track names that are longer than the average song length.


Question Set 3 - Advanced


Q1: Finds the amount spent by each customer on each artist.

Q2: Identifies the most popular music genre for each country.

Q3: Determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country.

The ER diagram for the database is included in the repository.
